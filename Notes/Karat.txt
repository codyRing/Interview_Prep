If interviewing is no one’s full time job, 
how can we expect interviews to be conducted with scientific rigor 
or be improved upon? Or be enjoyable or fair for candidates?



Interviews - Enjoyable - Predictive - Fair

----------------------------------------------------
Take home test then session with Interview Engineer? (tortoise Hare)
	
Any feedback from type 2 errors(Hire a non-competent candidate)
	-Hear from the client?
	
Any feedback from type 1 errors (reject talented candidate)
	-Talented employee who is inept (Markopolos warned about Madoff, The holy fool)
	-"Truth Tellers" that are rejected.
	-Boy, king with no clothes

What Demographic data do you know or attempt to mask?
	-Data back from clients to ensure "Predictive"
	-Men vs Women hired after Karat Interview
	
What data does Karat get back from employers

24 hour SLA. How does that manifest itself, Midnight calls?

-----------------------------------------------------


How Independent are the interview engineers, what is known about company, req and applicant?
Quality Control or peer review of Interview results?
What errors can an interview engineer make? (Errors decrease N interviews conducted increase)


How does the context influence the interview
	-Forgot the time / late notification
	-Interviewer swapped (Parametric/talking circles)
	-Option for a Re-do accounts for this error
	-time (tortoise not good at time limits)
	

How do you avoid tailoring the interview to a certain candidate?
	-Is it designed to favor tortoises or hares?
	-Time limits, smartest or who is smartest fastest.
	-Finding info Quickly
	-Harvard or yale and a successful lawyer

	
What are you screening for?
	-What would you predict?
	-Length of tenure
	-Performance review numbers
	-Client satisfaction
	-Screening for bare minimum?
	-Who gets rejected from Karat (True Negatives)


Talking in Circles.
	-Detailed about explaining their team or role
	-Karat accounts by not know the organization or requisition?
	
Is there any use to the white-board?
	-Can interviewers "sense" who will be a successful hire
	-Reject a holy fool
	-Too filled with Bias?
	


Question Design and Employer expectation?
	-Data Analyst could mean a lot of things to different people.
	-How to tailor questions while remaining employer agnostic
	-Input from the employers on questions?
	-Practicality (reading CSV from a url and sorting)
	


What can you eliminate from (Job_Req, interviewee anxiety, interview Engineer training, Feedback to clients (they need to understand this!!!))
	-Things that can be learned on the job don’t impact hiring decision
	-Things candidates need to come in with do impact hiring decision
	-What skills does the employer not care about (ETL vs Analysis)
	


Screen Candidates in
	-submit larger list of people to Karat?
	-Do more people get to Hiring manager after completing Karat interview?
	-Avoiding False positives - higher probability a successful candidate will be interviewed






Null Hypothesis - Hire a successful employee

False positive - reject true null hypothesis - Not hiring a successful candidate - Type 1
False Negative - accept a false null - Hiring a non-successful Candidate - Type 2

True Positives - accept the null - Hire a successful candidate
True Negative - reject a false null - Don't hire the non-successful candidate
	

	
(Comp Y axis Hire X)
FP				TP
High Comp		High Comp
Don't HIre		Hire

TN				FN
Low Comp		Low Comp
Don't Hire		Hire


Low P Value (p is low null must go)
Reject Null -  You are not hiring successful candidates
Confidence interval - N = 10 4 successful hires - 
Probability Distribution - of all candidates recommended smaller probability they will be successful
Result we see in sample is significant to overturn null hypothesis


Large P (Do not reject the null, non significant)
Karats methods are hiring the correct people
Confidence interval - N=10 9 successful hires.
Probability Distribution - of all candidates recommended Higher probability they will be successful
Result we see in sample is not enough to overturn hypothesis of population (hiring good people)




clients include Pinterest, Indeed, Citrix, Intuit, and Palantir.
Where else are clients being found?

Other disciplines (Verticals) outside of Software engineering CyberSecurity/AI?
